    <h1>Hi! I'm Jan, trainee at codaisseur</h1>

    <h2>Who is Jan?</h2>
    <p>I live in Groesbeek, a small village in the Netherlands. </p>
    <p>I worked in an alarm receiving center for a security company, handling al kinds of alarms like burglary alarms,
        fire alarms and even worked with IOT. Monitoring and tackling network issues was also a part of my job. </p>
    <p>I loved working with new technologies and to make websites. I made a few websites for small companies. Helping
        someone out by making a website. It is great to realize somebody’s ideas and vision in a website. </p>

    <h2>Why web development? </h2>
    <p>I am not a full-fledged web developer. I learned by myself how to make a site, used programming / markup
        languages like php, javascript, HTML/CSS and frameworks like bootstrap. </p>
    <p>I noticed that I didn't like my former job anymore. There weren't enough possibilities to grow. I had to reinvent
        myself. </p>
    <p>I really liked making websites, but I experienced that I needed some more depth to the products I was developing
        and was missing focus. I was doing all kinds of things like making a design, design a logo in Illustrator,
        copywriting, using coding languages like php, javascript. </p>
    <p>While I was building these sites, all kinds of questions came into my head which I did not have an answer for.
        How do I handle SEO? How do I integrate different systems by using an API? How do I speed up the page load.</p>
    <p>As you can see, I had too many questions. With every question a new one popped up. The biggest question remain..
        Where do I start? </p>
    <p>It was time to take some action. I was looking for a good course to advance in web development. I started a
        course at freecodecamp and asked for advice from developers I know. I also experienced that there are good
        courses on the web. By chance, I found codaisseur’s website. I really liked what they offered. It’s a good
        curriculum and with a clear focus. Working together at project to acquire the needed skills as web developer.
