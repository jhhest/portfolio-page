      <h1>Hi! I'm Jan, trainee at codaisseur.</h1>

    <main class="introduction">
      <h2>About Jan.</h2>
      <p>I live in Groesbeek, a small village in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>
        I worked in an alarm receiving center for a security company, handling
        al kinds of alarms like burglary alarms, fire alarms and even worked
        with IOT. Monitoring and tackling network issues was also a part of my
        job.
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved working with new technologies and to make websites. I made a few
        websites for small companies. Helping someone out by making a website.
        It is great to realize somebody’s ideas and vision in a website.
      </p>

      <h2>Why web development?</h2>
      <p>
        I am not a full-fledged web developer. I learned by myself how to make a
        site, used promming / markup languages like php, javascript, HTML/CSS
        and frameworks like bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that I didn't like my former job anymore. There weren't enough
        possibilities to grow. I had to reinvent myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really liked making websites, but I experienced that I needed some
        more depth to the products I was developing and was missing focus. I was
        doing all kinds of things like making a design, design a logo in
        Illustrator, copywriting, using coding languages like php, javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was building these sites, all kinds of questions came into my
        head which I did not have an answer for. How do I handle SEO? How do I
        intete different systems by using an API? How do I speed up the page
        load.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see, I had too many questions. With every question a new one
        popped up. The biggest question remain.. Where do I start?
      </p>
      <p>
        It was time to take some action. I was looking for a good course to
        advance in web development. I started a course at freecodecamp and asked
        for advice from developers I know. I also experienced that there are
        good courses on the web. By chance, I found codaisseur’s website. I
        really liked what they offered. It’s a good curriculum and with a clear
        focus. Working together at project to acquire the needed skills as web
        developer.
